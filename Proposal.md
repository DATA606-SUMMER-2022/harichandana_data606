### 500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health

#### Issue of interest
Health is a foremost important factor in the society. In the current fast living culture people are falling prey for chronic diseases. Unhealthy behaviors and eating habits are leading to chronic diseases like high blood pressures, diabetes and unhealthy cholestrol levels. Along with these people are also looking for ways to prevent these diseases by adopting much healthier choices. We have looked into the health data to explore more on the chronic diseases and how many people are into prevention and how many are taking action based on their health outcomes.

#### Issue importance
By working on this health data, we can get to know the quality of public health in these practical situations. The analysis of this health data will be useful in understanding the trend of the chronic diseased and the unhealthy behaviors leading to them. Also this data will be useful for introducing new health policies and other preventive measures like digitalized health applications that can target people from a specific demography. 

#### What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
* The main objective is to analyze the unhealthy behaviors, health outcomes and prevention (3 variables) responsible for chronic diseases in major cities.
* Which cities are more into prevention?
* Predicting cities which are more prone to chronic diseases?

#### Data source 
The source for this data is CDC(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)., Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch and this project of making this dataset was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS)
2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates.

Link for the dataset : [Dataset](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2018-relea/rja3-32tc)

This dataset was first created on December 4th, 2019.

Last release was on December 5th, 2019.

Size of dataset is 224.276 MB.

The dataset has 810k rows and 24 columns.

Dataset has information from 500 cities from the US which helps in bringing out data for better health.

#### Unit of analysis
Our unit of analysis would be category which comprises of unhealthy behaviors, prevention and health outcomes

#### What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
We plan to use cities, state, measure and easure id in our analysis.

What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
* Decision Tree
* Logistic Regression
* Cross Validation
* Grid Search
* KNN classifier
#### How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
We are planning to evaluate the metrics such as recall, accuracy, precision, f-1 score and  confusion matrix. 
#### What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
We will be visualizing data with the help of Tableau. We are also contemplating in using Plotly to develop dashboards stating the health status of the population in major cities.
